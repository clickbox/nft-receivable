/**
 * @title ReceivableToken
 * @author nftchance
 * @notice ReceivableToken is a contract that allows users to mint ERC721 tokens
 *         by paying a fee in ETH, ERC20, ERC721 or ERC1155 tokens depending on 
 *        the payment token type.
 * @dev The primary appeal of using this architecture is that a user does not have to 
 *      pre-approve the token besides for ERC20 due to the standard ERC20 interface.
 *      This is because the contract is not transferring the tokens from the user (besides for ERC20)
 *      and instead is processing the mint when a token is received. This is a more gas efficient
 *      approach than the standard ERC721 transferFrom approach that can complex caveats and orders.
 * @dev Because everything processes at the time of receiving, `mintToken()` is only used for ERC20 and
 *      everything else is a normal transfer.
